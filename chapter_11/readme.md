# This chapter requires a new virtual environment

For this chapter, I strongly recommend to create a virtual environment, based on the requirements.txt file.

The command to create a virtual environment is:

```python3 -m venv venv``` 

then 

```source venv```

and 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
